# PvT-model
In this repositary a MATLAB script has been developed to genereate a 3D P-v-T model of a pure substance. The script uses CANTERA library to get the value of pressure for a given value of tempearture and volume. The obtained 3D-surface was converted into an stl file which can be 3D - printed. 

During the project two type of MATLAB scripts. One script was able to make the surface for the inside of dome only. The other script was able to generate the full 3D-surface. 

Here is the surface plot inside the dome for CO2.

The completer surface plot is for CO2 is also shown.
